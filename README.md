------------Introduction--------------

This project contains fundamental algorithms for AI. The algorithms are implemented but not used for any AI functionality. You are
free to use them in your own AI projects. In the future I will start using them in other projects.
So you can think of this project as a tool kit for AI.

------------Getting started------------

After you have cloned the project you are ready to create an eclipse project. This is simply done by use of gradle (that is you need to install gradle). To create an eclipse project type 'gradle eclipse' in a commandline. Now you are able to import the project into eclipse and work with the code or use it.

If you on the other hand just wants to use the project as a jar file in your own project then simply build a jar. This is done from the commandline by typing 'gradle build'.
